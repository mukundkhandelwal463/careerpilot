## Why This Is Useful

Most people know their resume is weak, but do not know exactly what to fix. This project solves that by converting resume text into concrete decisions.

Why it matters:
- Reduces guesswork before applying.
- Improves ATS visibility through keyword and skills alignment.
- Gives direct next-step routing:
  - Good score -> apply to jobs.
  - Low score -> improve resume first.
- Helps recruiters quickly shortlist strong candidates using objective scoring.

In short: it saves time, improves quality, and increases decision confidence for both job seekers and hiring teams.
